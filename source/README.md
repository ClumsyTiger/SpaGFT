Recently, tissue module (TM) was defined as an architectural area containing recurrent cellular communities and executing specific biological functions at different tissue sites. However, the computational determination of TMs poses challenges owing to their various length scale, convoluted biological process, and irregular spatial patterns. In this study, we present SpaGFT, a hypothesis-free graph Fourier transform model, to identify spatially variable genes (SVGs) and characterize TMs. First, we described the mathematical principles of transforming complex gene expression patterns into simple, but informative signals; introduced the computational formulation of SVG identification; and compared the performance of SpaGFT to those of state-of-the-art tools. Next, we characterized TMs by clustering the transformed signals of SVGs and demonstrated the biological interpretations in various biological systems. The results revealed that SpaGFT can accurately identify SVGs at a fast-computing speed, and for the first time, provide a computational identity card for TMs. The superior accuracy, scalability, and interpretability of SpaGFT indicate that it is a novel and powerful tool for the investigation of TMs from a gene-centric perspective.
